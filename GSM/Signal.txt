You can get a signal strength reading by issuing an AT+CSQ to the modem. You will get a number on a scale of 0 to 31 with 0 being worst (< -113db) and 31 (> -51db) being best.

To calculate the actual receive level, issue the AT+CSQ command to the card. Take the number before the ,99 and multiply it by 2. Subtract that figure from -113dBm and that will give you your signal reading in dBm.

For example, a value of 13 results in -113dBm - (13x2) = -87dBm

and 17 in -113dBm - (17x2) = -79dBm.

For those who need to START -> RUN -> CALC to figure this out, here's the easy way...

0 < -113 dBm
1 -111 dBm
2 -109 dBm
3 -107 dBm
4 -105 dBm
5 -103 dBm
6 -101 dBm
7 -99 dBm
8 -97 dBm
9 -95 dBm
10 -93 dBm
11 -91 dBm
12 -89 dBm
13 -87 dBm
14 -85 dBm
15 -83 dBm
16 -81 dBm
17 -79 dBm
18 -77 dBm
19 -75 dBm
20 -73 dBm
21 -71 dBm
22 -69 dBm
23 -67 dBm
24 -65 dBm
25 -63 dBm
26 -61 dBm
27 -59 dBm
28 -57 dBm
29 -55 dBm
30 -53 dBm
31 > -51 dBm

Marginal - Levels of -95dBm or lower. At these sort of levels, it is very likely that you may suffer low throughput and disconnects due to cell loading/breathing even with an outdoor antenna.

Workable under most conditions - Levels of -85dBm to -95dBm. Probably worth considering an outdoor gain type antenna. Could suffer poor throughput and disconnects due to cell loading/breathing.

Good - Levels between -75dBm and -85dBm - normally no problem holding a connection with this sort of level (even with cell breathing) without the use of an external antenna.

Excellent - levels above -75dBm. Should not be affected by cell breathing/loading and should not require an external antenna.
